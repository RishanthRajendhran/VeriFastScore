Here are some common causes:\n\n1. **Hormonal Imbalance**: Fluctuations in hormones such as estrogen and progesterone can cause irregular menstrual cycles. This can be due to stress, changes in weight, or other underlying health conditions.\n\n2. **Birth Control**: If you have recently started, stopped, or changed your method of birth control, it can affect your menstrual cycle. Hormonal contraceptives, in particular, can cause irregular bleeding.\n\n3. **Stress**: High levels of stress can impact your menstrual cycle by affecting the hormones that regulate it.\n\n4. **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)**: PCOS is a common condition that can cause irregular periods, including having more than one period in a month.\n\n5. **Thyroid Issues**: Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can affect your menstrual cycle.\n\n6. **Uterine Fibroids or Polyps**: These are non-cancerous growths in the uterus that can cause irregular bleeding.\n\n7. **Infections**: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or other infections can cause irregular bleeding.\n\n8. **Perimenopause**: Though less common at your age, some women can start experiencing perimenopause symptoms earlier, which can lead to irregular periods.\n\n9. **Lifestyle Factors**: Significant changes in diet, exercise, or sleep patterns can also affect your menstrual cycle.\n\n10. **Medical Conditions**: Other medical conditions, such as diabetes or eating disorders, can also impact your menstrual cycle.\n\nIf this is a one-time occurrence, it might not be a cause for concern. However, if you continue to experience irregular periods or have other symptoms, it would be a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider.
